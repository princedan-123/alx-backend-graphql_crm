# **Understanding GraphQL** üìù

This project, **Understanding GraphQL**, explores the fundamentals of GraphQL and its practical application in a Django environment. It focuses on building a simple CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system to demonstrate how GraphQL provides a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs. The goal is to build a robust API that can handle data querying, manipulation, and filtering with precision.

## **Key Concepts** üß†

### **GraphQL vs. REST**

Unlike **REST**, which uses multiple endpoints for different resources (e.g., `/customers`, `/products`), GraphQL uses a **single endpoint** (`/graphql`) for all operations. This allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

### **Core Components**

-   **Schema**: A schema is a central contract that defines all the data a client can request. It includes **types**, **queries** (for fetching data), and **mutations** (for creating, updating, or deleting data).
    
-   **Queries**: Used to retrieve data from the server. Clients specify the fields they want, and the server returns only that data.
    
-   **Mutations**: Used to modify data on the server. They are like a **`POST`**, **`PUT`**, or **`DELETE`** in REST but are defined within the GraphQL schema.
    
-   **Resolvers**: Functions that execute the logic for a specific field in a query or mutation. They are responsible for fetching the requested data from the database or other sources.

## **Implementation Details** üõ†Ô∏è

This project was built using **Django** and **`graphene-django`**, a powerful library that seamlessly integrates GraphQL into Django applications.

### **Task 0: Setting Up the GraphQL Endpoint**

1.  **Project Setup**: A new Django project, `alx-backend-graphql_crm`, was created, along with a `crm` app.
    
2.  **Schema Definition**: A basic GraphQL schema was defined in `alx-backend-graphql_crm/schema.py` with a simple `hello` query that returns a string.
    
3.  **Endpoint Connection**: The GraphQL endpoint was configured in `urls.py` using `GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True)`, which provides a user-friendly browser-based IDE (**GraphiQL**) for testing queries and mutations.
    

### **Task 1 & 2: Building and Seeding the CRM Database**

The project was extended to include a **CRM** database with models for **`Customer`**, **`Product`**, and **`Order`**. GraphQL **mutations** were implemented to handle data manipulation.

-   **`CreateCustomer`**: A mutation to add a single customer with validation for unique emails and phone number formats.
    
-   **`BulkCreateCustomers`**: A more complex mutation to handle a list of customers in a single request, with robust error handling for partial success.
    
-   **`CreateProduct`**: A mutation to add products with validation for price and stock.
    
-   **`CreateOrder`**: A mutation to create an order, associate it with a customer and products, and calculate the total amount. This task involved handling **nested object** creation and providing custom, user-friendly error messages.
    

### **Task 3: Implementing Advanced Features**

**Filtering and Sorting** were implemented to enhance the querying capabilities.

-   **`django-filter`**: This library was used to create custom filter sets for `Customer`, `Product`, and `Order` models, allowing for complex lookups (e.g., case-insensitive search, date ranges).
    
-   **`DjangoFilterConnectionField`**: `graphene-django`'s built-in filtering capabilities were used to integrate the custom filter sets with the GraphQL queries, providing a powerful and flexible search API.
    
-   **Sorting**: The `order_by` argument was added to queries to allow clients to sort results based on various fields, such as name or price.

## **How to Run the Project**

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/alx-backend-graphql-crm.git
    cd alx-backend-graphql-crm
    
    ```
    
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```
    
3.  **Run migrations**:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    
    ```
    
4.  **Start the server**:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    
    ```
    
5.  **Access the GraphQL endpoint**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/graphql` in your browser to use the **GraphiQL** interface.

## **Learning Outcomes** ‚úÖ

This project successfully demonstrated the implementation of a GraphQL API in a Django application. By completing this project, I have gained a solid understanding of:

-   **GraphQL vs. REST** and when to use each.
    
-   Designing a **GraphQL schema** with types, queries, and mutations.
    
-   Using **`graphene-django`** for seamless integration with Django models.
    
-   Implementing **advanced features** like filtering, sorting, and custom error handling.
    
-   Using **GraphiQL** and other tools to test and document GraphQL APIs.
